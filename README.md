# HW_OOP_1309
Create a stack that contains methods to add (push) and remove (ror) elements. Also implement the torus method that returns the top
stack element without removing it.
----------------------------------
Develop a program that simulates the "Undo" and "Redo" functions in a text editor. 
Use two stacks: one to store user actions and one to store canceled actions.
The user can enter actions such as adding text, deleting text, etc., and the application must allow him to undo and redo those actions.
